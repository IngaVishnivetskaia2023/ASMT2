## Server-side Rendering & Building Fullstack Apps with Next.js

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to do the following:

- Describe the difference between client-side and server-side React
- Determine which kind of React app to build
- Build fullstack React apps with the help of the Next.js framework
- Explain the key features and advantages of Next.js

### Introduction
Thus far in this book, you have learned a lot about building client-side React applications, that is, applications where the (transpiled) React code executes in the browsers of your website visitors.

This makes sense because React was originally created to simplify the process of building interactive and reactive UIs by running JavaScript code on the client side. 
To this date, most React features, including the ones covered up to this point in this book (e.g., state, context, and routing), exist to fulfill this purpose.

But, as you will learn in this and the following chapters, you can actually also **execute React code on the server side**. 
There are certain React features that may only be used there—for example, **React Server Components**, which will be covered in great detail in the Chapter 16, React Server Components & Server Actions.

This chapter will get you started with React on the server side, briefly explain what **server-side rendering (SSR)** is, and introduce you to Next.js, a popular and feature-rich fullstack framework for React that allows you to blend backend and frontend code. 
You will learn how to create Next.js apps and how to use core Next.js features like file-based routing.
