## Understanding React Components and JSX

### What Are Components?
A key concept of React is the usage of so-called components. Components are reusable building blocks that are combined to compose the final user interface. 
For example, a basic website could be made up of a sidebar that includes navigation items and a main section that includes elements for adding and viewing tasks.

### Why Components?
No matter which web page you look at, they are all made up of building blocks like this. 
**It’s not a React-specific concept or idea.** Indeed, HTML itself “thinks” in components if you take a closer look. 
You have elements like `<img>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, etc., and you combine these elements to describe and structure your website content.

But React embraces this idea of breaking a web page into reusable building blocks because it is an approach that allows developers to work on small, manageable chunks of code. 
It’s easier and more maintainable than working on a single, huge HTML (or React code) file.

That’s why other libraries—both frontend libraries like `React` or `Angular` as well as backend libraries and templating engines like `EJS` (Embedded JavaScript templates)—also embrace components 
(though the names might differ, you also find “partials” or “includes” as common names).

### What Exactly Are Component Functions?
In React, **components are functions** (or classes, but as mentioned above, those aren’t relevant anymore).

A function is **a regular JavaScript construct, not a React-specific concept**. This is important to note. 
**React is a JavaScript library** and consequently uses JavaScript features (like functions); React is not a brand-new programming language.

When working with React, regular JavaScript functions can be used to encapsulate HTML (or, to be more precise, JSX) code and JavaScript logic that belongs to that markup code. 
However, it depends on the code you write in a function whether it qualifies to be treated as a React component or not. 
For example, in the code snippets above, the `handleSubmit` function is also a regular JavaScript function, but it’s not a React component. 
The following example shows another regular JavaScript function that doesn’t qualify as a React component:

```
function calculate(a, b) {
  return {sum: a + b};
};
```

Indeed, **a function will be treated as a component and can therefore be used like an HTML element in JSX code if it returns a renderable value (typically JSX code)**. 
This is very important. 
❗ You can only use a function as a React component in JSX code if it is a function that returns something that can be rendered by React. 
The returned value technically doesn’t have to be JSX code, but in most cases, it will be. 
You will see an example of non-JSX code being returned in Chapter 7, Portals and Refs.

When working with vanilla JavaScript, you, of course, typically call functions to execute them. With functional components, that’s different. 
**React calls these functions on your behalf**, and for that reason, as a developer, you use them like HTML elements inside of this JSX code.
