## Handling Side Effects

### What’s the Problem?
Before exploring a solution, it’s important to first understand the concrete problem.

Actions **that are not directly related to producing a (new) user interface state often clash with React’s component rendering cycle**. They may introduce bugs or even break the entire web app.

Consider the following example code snippet (important: don’t execute this code as it will cause an infinite loop and send a large number of HTTP requests behind the scenes):

```
import { useState } from 'react';
import classes from './BlogPosts.module.css';
async function fetchPosts() {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  const blogPosts = await response.json();
  return blogPosts;
}
function BlogPosts() {
  const [loadedPosts, setLoadedPosts] = useState([]);
  fetchPosts().then((fetchedPosts) => setLoadedPosts(fetchedPosts));
  return (
    <ul className={classes.posts}>
      {loadedPosts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
export default BlogPosts;
```

So what’s the problem with this code? Why does it create an infinite loop?

In this example, a React component (`BlogPosts`) is created. In addition, a non-component function (`fetchPosts()`) is defined. 
That function uses the built-in `fetch()` function (provided by the browser) to send an HTTP request to an external application programming interface (API) and fetch some data.

In the preceding code snippet, the `BlogPosts` component utilizes `useState()` to register a `loadedPosts` state value. 
The state is used to output a list of blog posts. Those blog posts are not defined in the app itself though. Instead, they are fetched from the external API mentioned in the note box.

`fetchPosts()`, which is the utility function that contains the code for fetching blog posts data from that backend API using the built-in `fetch()` function, is called directly in the component function body. 
Since `fetchPosts()` is an async function (using `async/await`), it returns a **promise**. 
In `BlogPosts`, the code that should be executed once **the promise resolves** is registered via the built-in `then()` method.

❗ 
#### Note

`async/await` is **not used directly in the component function body** because regular React components **must not be async functions**. 
Such functions automatically return a promise as a value (even without an explicit return statement), which is an **invalid** return value for a React component.

That being said, there are indeed React components that are allowed to use async/await and return a promise. 
So-called **React Server Components** are not restricted to returning JSX code, strings, etc. 
This feature will be discussed in detail in Chapter 16, React Server Components & Server Actions.

Once the `fetchPosts()` promise resolves, the extracted posts data (`fetchedPosts`) is set as the new `loadedPosts` state (via `setLoadedPosts(fetchedPosts)`).

If you were to run the preceding code (which you should not do!), it would at first seem to work. But behind the scenes, it would **actually start an infinite loop, hammering the API with HTTP requests**. 
This is because, as a result of getting a response from the HTTP request, `setLoadedPosts()` is used to set a new state.

Earlier in this book (in Chapter 4, Working with Events and State), you learned that **whenever the state of a component changes, React re-evaluates the component to which the state belongs**. 
“Re-evaluating” simply means that the component function is executed again (by React, automatically).

Since this `BlogPosts` component calls `fetchPosts()` (which sends an HTTP request) directly inside the component function body, this HTTP request will be sent every time the component function is executed. 
And as the state (`loadedPosts`) is updated as a result of getting a response from that HTTP request, this process begins again, and an infinite loop is created.

The root problem, in this case, is that **sending an HTTP request is a side effect**—a concept that will be explored in greater detail in the next section.

### Understanding Side Effects
Side effects are actions or processes that occur in addition to another main process. 
At least, this is a concise definition that helps with understanding side effects in the context of a React app.

🗒️ If you want to dive deeper into the concept of side effects, you can also explore the following discussion about side effects on Stack Overflow: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/40297/what-is-a-side-effect.

For this, React considers state changes as the trigger for updating the user interface. Registering event handlers such as onClick, adding refs, or rendering child components (possibly by using props) would be other elements that belong to this main process—because all these concepts are directly related to the main task of rendering the desired user interface.

Sending an HTTP request, as in the preceding example, is not part of this main process, though. It doesn’t directly influence the user interface. While the response data might eventually be output on the screen, it definitely won’t be used in the exact same component render cycle in which the request is sent (because HTTP requests are asynchronous tasks).

Since sending the HTTP request is not part of the main process (rendering the user interface) that’s performed by the component function, it’s considered a side effect. It’s invoked by the same function (the BlogPosts component function), which primarily has a different goal.

**If the HTTP request were sent upon a click of a button rather than as part of the main component function body, it would not be a side effect**. Consider this example:
```
import { useState } from 'react';
import classes from './BlogPosts.module.css';
async function fetchPosts() {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  const blogPosts = await response.json();
  return blogPosts;
}
function BlogPosts() {
  const [loadedPosts, setLoadedPosts] = useState([]);
  function handleFetchPosts() {
    fetchPosts().then((fetchedPosts) => setLoadedPosts(fetchedPosts));
  }
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleFetchPosts}>Fetch Posts</button>
      <ul className={classes.posts}>
        {loadedPosts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
export default BlogPosts;
```

This code is almost identical to the previous example, but it has one important difference: a `<button>` was added to the JSX code. And it’s this button that invokes a newly added `handleFetchPosts()` function, which then sends the HTTP request (and updates the state).

With this change made, the HTTP request is not sent every time the component function re-renders (that is, is executed again). Instead, it’s only sent whenever the button is clicked, and therefore, this does not create an infinite loop. The HTTP request, in this case, also doesn’t postulate a side effect, because the primary goal of `handleFetchPosts()` (i.e., the main process) is to fetch new posts and update the state.

#### Here’s a non-exhaustive list of examples of side effects:

- Sending an HTTP request (as shown previously)
- Storing data to or fetching data from browser storage (for example, via the built-in `localStorage` object)
- Setting timers (via `setTimeout()`) or intervals (via `setInterval()`)
- Logging data to the console via `console.log()`

Not all side effects cause infinite loops, however. Such loops only occur if the side effect leads to a state update.

Here’s an example of a side effect that would not cause an infinite loop:
```
function ControlCenter() {
  function handleStart() {
    // do something ...
  }
  console.log('Component is rendering!'); // this is a side effect!
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Press button to start the review process</p>
      <button onClick={handleStart}>Start</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `console.log(…)` is a side effect because it’s executed as part of every component function execution and does not influence the rendered user interface (neither for this specific render cycle nor indirectly for any future render cycles in this case, unlike the previous example with the HTTP request).

Of course, using `console.log()` like this is not causing any problems. During development, it’s quite normal to log messages or data for debugging purposes. Side effects aren’t necessarily a problem and, indeed, side effects like this can be used or tolerated.

But you also often need to deal with side effects such as the HTTP request from before. Sometimes, you need to fetch data when a component renders—probably not for every render cycle, but typically the first time it is executed (that is, when its generated user interface appears on the screen for the first time).

React offers a solution for this kind of problem as well.

### Dealing with Side Effects with the useEffect() Hook

In order to deal with side effects such as the HTTP request shown previously in a safe way (that is, without creating an infinite loop), React offers another core Hook: the `useEffect()` Hook.

The first example can be fixed and rewritten like this:

```
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import classes from './BlogPosts.module.css';
async function fetchPosts() {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  const blogPosts = await response.json();
  return blogPosts;
}
function BlogPosts() {
  const [loadedPosts, setLoadedPosts] = useState([]);
  useEffect(function () {
    fetchPosts().then((fetchedPosts) => setLoadedPosts(fetchedPosts));
  }, []);
  return (
    <ul className={classes.posts}>
      {loadedPosts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
export default BlogPosts;
```

In this example, the `useEffect()` Hook is imported and used to control the side effect (hence the name of the Hook, `useEffect()`, as it deals with side effects in React components).

`useEffect()` is therefore the solution for problems like the one outlined previously. It helps you **deal with side effects** so that you can avoid infinite loops and **extract them from your component function’s main process**.

But how does `useEffect() work`, and how is it used correctly?

### How to Use useEffect()
As shown in the previous example code snippet, `useEffect()`, like all React Hooks, is executed as a function inside the component function (`BlogPosts`, in this case).

Although, unlike `useState()` or `useRef()`, `useEffect()` does not return a value, though it does accept an argument (or, actually, two arguments) like those other Hooks. The first argument is always a function. In this case, the function passed to `useEffect()` is an anonymous function, created via the function keyword.

Alternatively, you could also provide an anonymous function created as an arrow function (`useEffect(() => { … })`) or point at some named function (`useEffect(doSomething)`). The only thing that matters is that the first argument passed to `useEffect()` **must be a function**. It must not be any other kind of value.

In the preceding example, `useEffect()` also receives a second argument: an empty array (`[]`). The second argument **must be an array**, but providing it is optional. You could also omit the second argument and just pass the first argument (the function) to `useEffect()`. However, in most cases, the second argument is needed to achieve the correct behavior. Both arguments and their purpose will be explored in greater detail as follows.

The first argument is a function that will be executed by React. **It will be executed after every component render cycle (that is, after every component function execution)**.

**In the preceding example, if you only provide this first argument and omit the second, you will therefore still create an infinite loop**. There will be an (invisible) timing difference because the HTTP request will now be sent **after** every component function execution (instead of as part of it), but you will still trigger a state change, which will still trigger the component function to execute again. Therefore, the effect function will run again, and an infinite loop will be created. In this case, the side effect will be extracted out of the component function technically, but the problem with the infinite loop will not be solved:

```
useEffect(function () {
  fetchPosts().then((fetchedPosts) => setLoadedPosts(fetchedPosts));
}); // this would cause an infinite loop again!
```

Extracting side effects out of React component functions is the main job of `useEffect()`, and so only the first argument (the function that contains the side effect code) is mandatory. But, as mentioned previously, you will also **typically need the second argument to control the frequency with which the effect code will be executed**, because that’s what the second argument (an array) will do.

The second parameter received by `useEffect()` is always an array (unless it’s omitted). This array specifies the dependencies of the effect function. Any dependency specified in this array will, once it changes, cause the effect function to execute again. If no array is specified (that is, if the second argument is omitted), the effect function will be executed again for every component function execution:
```
useEffect(function () {
  fetchPosts().then((fetchedPosts) => setLoadedPosts(fetchedPosts));
}, []);
```

In the preceding example, the second argument was not omitted, but it’s an empty array. This informs React that this effect function has no dependencies. Therefore, the effect function will never be executed again. Instead, it will only be executed **once**, when the component is rendered for the first time. If you set no dependencies (by providing an empty array), React will execute the effect function once—directly after the component function was executed for the first time.

It’s important to note that specifying an empty array is very different from omitting it. If it is omitted, no dependency information is provided to React. Therefore, React executes the effect function after every component re-evaluation. If an empty array is provided instead, you explicitly state that this effect has no dependencies and therefore should only run once.

This brings up another important question, though: when should you add dependencies? And how exactly are dependencies added or specified?


### Effects and Their Dependencies
Omitting the second argument to `useEffect()` causes the effect function (the first argument) to execute after **every** component function execution. Providing an **empty** array causes the effect function to run only **once** (after the first component function invocation). But is that all you can control?

No, it isn’t.

The array passed to `useEffect()` can and should contain **all variables, constants, or functions that are used inside the effect function**—if those variables, constants, or functions **were defined inside the component function** (or in some parent component function, passed down via props).

Consider this example:
```
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import classes from './BlogPosts.module.css';
async function fetchPosts(url) {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const blogPosts = await response.json();
  return blogPosts;
}
function BlogPosts({ url }) {
  const [loadedPosts, setLoadedPosts] = useState([]);
  useEffect(function () {
    fetchPosts(url)
     .then((fetchedPosts) => setLoadedPosts(fetchedPosts));
  }, [url]);
  return (
    <ul className={classes.posts}>
      {loadedPosts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
export default BlogPosts;
```

This example is based on the previous example, but was adjusted in one important place: BlogPosts now accepts a url prop.

Therefore, this component can now be used and configured by other components. Of course, if some other component sets a URL that doesn’t return a list of blog posts, the app won’t work as intended. This component therefore might be of limited practical use, but it does show the importance of effect dependencies quite well.

But if that other component changes the URL (e.g., due to some user input there), a new request should be sent, of course. So BlogPosts should send another fetch request every time the url prop value changes.

That’s why url was added to the dependencies array of useEffect(). If the array had been kept empty, the effect function would only run once (as described in the previous section). Therefore, any changes to url wouldn’t have any effect (no pun intended) on the effect function or the HTTP request executed as part of that function. No new HTTP request would be sent.

By adding url to the dependencies array, React registers this value (in this case, a prop value, but any value can be registered) and re-executes the effect function whenever that value changes (that is, whenever a new url prop value is set by the component that uses BlogPosts).

The most common types of effect dependencies are state values, props, and functions that might be executed inside of the effect function. The latter will be analyzed in greater depth later in this chapter.

As a rule, you should add all values (including functions) that are used inside an effect function to the effect dependencies array.

With this new knowledge in mind, if you take another look at the preceding useEffect() example code, you might spot some missing dependencies:

```
useEffect(function () {
  fetchPosts(url)
    .then((fetchedPosts) => setLoadedPosts(fetchedPosts));
}, [url]);
```

Why are `fetchPosts`, `fetchedPosts`, and `setLoadedPosts` not added as dependencies? 
These are, after all, values and functions used inside of the effect function. The next section will address this in detail.

### Unnecessary Dependencies
In the previous example, it might seem as if `fetchPosts`, `fetchedPosts`, and `setLoadedPosts` should be added as dependencies to `useEffect()`, as shown here:
```
useEffect(function () {
  fetchPosts(url)
    .then((fetchedPosts) => setLoadedPosts(fetchedPosts));
}, [url, fetchPosts, fetchedPosts, setLoadedPosts]);

```

However, for `fetchPosts` and `fetchedPosts`, this would be **incorrect**. And for `setLoadedPosts`, it would be unnecessary.

`fetchedPosts` should not be added because **it’s not an external dependency**. It’s a local variable (or **argument**, to be precise), defined and used inside the effect function. It’s not defined in the component function to which the effect belongs. If you try to add it as a dependency, you’ll get an error.

`fetchPosts`, the function that sends the actual HTTP request, is not a function defined **inside** of the effect function. 
But it still **shouldn’t be added** because it is defined **outside the component function**.

Therefore, there is no way for this function to change. It’s defined once (in the `BlogPosts.jsx` file), and it can’t change. That said, this would not be the case if it were defined inside the component function. In that case, whenever the component function executes again, the `fetchPosts` function would be recreated as well. This is a scenario that will be discussed later in this chapter (in the Functions as Dependencies section).

In this example though, `fetchPosts` can’t change. Therefore, it doesn’t have to be added as a dependency (and consequently should not be). The same would be true for functions, or any kind of values, provided **by the browser or third-party packages**. Any value that’s not defined inside a component function shouldn’t be added to the dependencies array.

❗ 
#### Note

It may be confusing that a function could change—after all, the logic is hardcoded, right? But in JavaScript, functions are actually **just objects and therefore may change**. 
When the code that contains a function is executed again (e.g., a component function being executed again by React), a new function object will be created in memory.

If this is not something you’re familiar with, the following resource should be helpful: https://academind.com/tutorials/javascript-functions-are-objects.

So `fetchedPosts` and `fetchPosts` should both not be added (for different reasons). What about `setLoadedPosts`?

`setLoadedPosts` is the state updating function returned by `useState()` for the `loadedPosts` state value. Therefore, like `fetchPosts`, it’s a function. Unlike `fetchPosts`, though, it’s a function that’s defined inside the component function (because `useState()` is called inside the component function). It’s a function created by React (since it’s returned by `useState()`), but it’s still a function. **Theoretically, it should therefore be added as a dependency**. And indeed, you can add it **without any negative consequences**.

But state updating functions returned by `useState()` are a special case: React guarantees that those functions will never change or be recreated. When the surrounding component function (`BlogPosts`) is executed again, `useState()` also executes again. However, a new state updating function is only created the first time a component function is called by React. Subsequent executions don’t lead to a new state updating function being created.

Because of this special behavior (i.e., **React guaranteeing that the function itself never changes**), state updating functions **may (and actually should) be omitted from the dependencies array**.

For all these reasons, `fetchedPosts`, `fetchPosts`, and `setLoadedPosts` should all not be added to the dependencies array of `useEffect()`. `url` is the only dependency used by the effect function that may change (that is, when the user enters a new URL into the input field) and therefore should be listed in the array.

To sum it up, when it comes to adding values to the effect dependencies array, there are three kinds of exceptions:

- Internal values (or functions) that are defined and used **inside the effect** (such as `fetchedPosts`)
- External values that are **not defined inside a component** function (such as `fetchPosts`)
- State updating functions (such as `setLoadedPosts`)

**In all other cases, if a value is used in the effect function, it must be added to the dependencies array!** Omitting values incorrectly can lead to unexpected effect executions (that is, an effect executing too often or not often enough).

### Cleaning Up after Effects
To perform a certain task (for example, sending an HTTP request), many effects should simply be triggered when their dependencies change. While some effects can be re-executed multiple times without issue, there are also effects that, if they execute again before the previous task has finished, are an indication that the task performed needs to be canceled. Or, maybe there is some other kind of cleanup work that should be performed when the same effect executes again.

Here’s an example, where an effect sets a timer:
```
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
function Alert() {
  const [alertDone, setAlertDone] = useState(false);
  useEffect(function () {
    console.log('Starting Alert Timer!');
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log('Timer expired!');
      setAlertDone(true);
    }, 2000);
  }, []);
  return (
    <>
      {!alertDone && <p>Relax, you still got some time!</p>}
      {alertDone && <p>Time to get up!</p>}
    </>
  );
}
export default Alert;
```

This `Alert` component is used in the `App` component:
```
import { useState } from 'react';
import Alert from './components/Alert.jsx';
function App() {
  const [showAlert, setShowAlert] = useState(false);
  function handleShowAlert() {
    // state updating is done by passing a function to setShowAlert
    // because the new state depends on the previous state (it's the opposite)
    setShowAlert((isShowing) => !isShowing);
  }
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleShowAlert}>
        {showAlert ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} Alert
      </button>
      {showAlert && <Alert />}
    </>
  );
}
export default App;
```

In the App component, the Alert component is shown conditionally. The showAlert state is toggled via the handleShowAlert function (which is triggered upon a button click).

In the Alert component, a timer is set using useEffect(). Without useEffect(), an infinite loop would be created, since the timer, upon expiration, changes some component state (the alertDone state via the setAlertDone state updating function).

The dependency array is an empty array because this effect function does not use any component values, variables, or functions. console.log() and setTimeout() are functions built into the browser (and therefore external functions), and setAlertDone() can be omitted because of the reasons mentioned in the previous section.

If you run this app and then start toggling the alert (by clicking the button), you’ll notice strange behavior. The timer is set every time the Alert component is rendered. But it’s not clearing the existing timer. This is due to the fact that multiple timers are running simultaneously, as you can clearly see if you look at the JavaScript console in your browser’s developer tools.

<img width="880" height="343" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6097697c-5e64-4263-93db-34c9da511855" />

This example is deliberately kept simple, but there are other scenarios in which you may have an ongoing HTTP request that should be aborted before a new one is sent. There are cases like that, where an effect should be cleaned up first before it runs again.

React also provides a solution for those kinds of situations: the effect function passed as a first argument to useEffect() can return an optional cleanup function. If you do return a function inside your effect function, React will execute that function **every time BEFORE it runs the effect again**.

Here’s the useEffect() call of the Alert component with a cleanup function being returned:
```
useEffect(function () {
  let timer;
  console.log('Starting Alert Timer!');
  timer = setTimeout(function () {
    console.log('Timer expired!');
    setAlertDone(true);
  }, 2000);
  return function() {
    clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, []);
```

In this updated example, a new timer variable (a local variable that is only accessible inside the effect function) is added. That variable stores a reference to the timer that’s created by setTimeout(). This reference can then be used together with clearTimeout() to remove a timer.

The timer is removed in a function returned by the effect function—which is the cleanup function that will be executed automatically by React before the effect function is called the next time.

You can see the cleanup function in action if you add a console.log() statement to it:

```
return function() {
  console.log('Cleanup!');
  clearTimeout(timer);
}
```

In your JavaScript console, this looks as follows:

<img width="878" height="361" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c00a096-b30d-43d8-a1b9-ec051a713895" />

In the preceding screenshot, you can see that **the cleanup function is executed (indicated by the Cleanup! log) right before the effect function is executed again**. You can also see that the timer is cleared successfully: the first timer never expires (there is no Timer expired! log for the first timer in the screenshot).

The cleanup function is not executed when the effect function is called for the first time. However, it will be called by React whenever a component that contains an effect **unmounts (that is, when it’s removed from the DOM)**.

If an effect has multiple dependencies, the effect function will be executed whenever any of the dependency values change. Therefore, the cleanup function will also be called every time some dependency changes.

### Dealing with Multiple Effects
Thus far, all the examples in this chapter have dealt with only one useEffect() call. You are not limited to only one call per component though. You can call useEffect() as often as needed—and can therefore register as many effect functions as needed.

#### But how many effect functions do you need?

You could start putting every side effect into its own `useEffect()` wrapper. You could put every HTTP request, every console.log() statement, and every timer into separate effect functions.

That said, as you can see in some of the previous examples—specifically, the code snippet in the previous section—that’s not necessary. There, you have multiple effects in one useEffect() call (three console.log() statements and one timer).

A better approach would be to split your effect functions by dependencies. If one side effect depends on state `A` and another side effect depends on state `B`, you could put them into separate effect functions (unless those two states are related), as shown here:

```
function Demo() {
  const [a, setA] = useState(0); // state updating functions aren't called
  const [b, setB] = useState(0); // in this example
  useEffect(function() {
    console.log(a);
  }, [a]);  
 
  useEffect(function() {
    console.log(b);
  }, [b]);
  // return some JSX code ...
}
```

But the best approach is to split your effect functions **by logic**. If one effect deals with fetching data via an HTTP request and another effect is about setting a timer, it will often make sense to put them into different effect functions (that is, different `useEffect()` calls).

### Functions as Dependencies
Different effects have different kinds of dependencies, and one common kind of dependency is functions.

As mentioned previously, functions in JavaScript are just objects. Therefore, whenever some code that contains a function definition is executed, a new function object is created and stored in memory. When calling a function, it’s that specific function object in memory that is executed. In some scenarios (for example, for functions defined in component functions), it’s possible that multiple objects based on the same function code exist in memory.

❗ Because of this behavior, functions that are referenced in code are not necessarily equal, even if they are based on the same function definition.
