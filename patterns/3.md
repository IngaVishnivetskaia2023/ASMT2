## Chapter 5. Modern JavaScript Syntax and Features
JavaScript has been around for many decades now and has undergone multiple revisions. 
This book explores design patterns in the modern JavaScript context and uses modern ES2015+ syntax for all the examples discussed. 
This chapter discusses ES2015+ JavaScript features and syntax essential to further our discussion of design patterns in the current JavaScript context.

#### Note
Some fundamental changes were introduced to JavaScript syntax with ES2015 that are especially relevant to our discussion on patterns. These are covered well in the BabelJS ES2015 guide.

This book relies on modern JavaScript syntax. You may also be curious about TypeScript. 
TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, offers several language features that JavaScript does not. 
These features include strong typing, interfaces, enums, and advanced type inference and can also influence design patterns. 
To learn more about TypeScript and its benefits, consider checking out some O’Reilly books such as Programming TypeScript by Boris Cherny.

### The Importance of Decoupling Applications
Modular JavaScript allows you to logically split your application into smaller pieces called modules. 
A module can be imported by other modules that, in turn, can be imported by more modules. Thus, the application can be composed of many nested modules.

In the world of scalable JavaScript, when we say an application is modular, we often mean it’s composed of a set of highly decoupled, distinct pieces of functionality stored in modules. 
Loose coupling facilitates easier maintainability of apps by removing dependencies where possible. If implemented efficiently, it allows you to see how changes to one part of a system may affect another.

Unlike some more traditional programming languages, the older iterations of JavaScript until ES5 (Standard ECMA-262 5.1 Edition) did not provide developers with the means to organize and import code modules cleanly. It was one of the concerns with the specifications that had not required great thought until more recent years when the need for more organized JavaScript applications became apparent. AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) and CommonJS modules were the most popular patterns to decouple applications in the initial versions of JavaScript.

Native solutions to these problems arrived with ES6 or ES2015 (https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/). TC39, the standards body charged with defining the syntax and semantics of ECMAScript and its future iterations, had been keeping a close eye on the evolution of JavaScript usage for large-scale development and was acutely aware of the need for better language features for writing more modular JS.

The syntax to create modules in JavaScript was developed and standardized with the release of ECMAScript modules in ES2015. 
Today, all major browsers support JavaScript modules. They have become the de facto method of implementing modern-day modular programming in JavaScript. 
In this section, we’ll explore code samples using the syntax for modules in ES2015+.
