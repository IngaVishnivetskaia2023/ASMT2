## Chapter 2. “Pattern”-ity Testing, Proto-Patterns, and the Rule of Three

From the moment a new pattern is proposed to its potential widespread adoption, a pattern may have to go through multiple rounds of deep inspection by the design community and software developers. 
This chapter talks about this journey of a newly introduced “proto-pattern” through a “pattern”-ity test until it is eventually recognized as a pattern if it meets the rule of three.

This and the next chapter explore the approach to structuring, writing, presenting, and reviewing nascent design patterns. 
If you’d prefer to learn established design patterns first, you can skip these two chapters for the time being.

### What Are Proto-Patterns?
Remember that not every algorithm, best practice, or solution represents what might be considered a complete pattern. There may be a few key ingredients missing, and the pattern community is generally wary of something claiming to be one without an extensive and critical evaluation. 
Even if something is presented to us which appears to meet the criteria for a pattern, we should not consider it as one until it has undergone suitable periods of scrutiny and testing by others.

Looking back upon Alexander’s work once more, he claims that a pattern should be both a process and a “thing.” 
This definition is obtuse as he follows by saying that it is the process that should create the “thing.” 
This is why patterns generally focus on addressing a visually identifiable structure; 
we should be able to visually depict (or draw) a picture representing the structure resulting from placing the pattern into practice.

### The “Pattern” Tests
You may often come across the term “proto-pattern” when studying design patterns. What is this? Well, a pattern that has not yet conclusively passed the “pattern”-ity tests is usually referred to as a proto-pattern. Proto-patterns may result from the work of someone who has established a particular solution worthy of sharing with the community. However, due to its relatively young age, the community has not had the opportunity to vet the proposed solution suitably.

Alternatively, the individual(s) sharing the pattern may not have the time or interest in going through the “pattern”-ity process and might release a short description of their proto-pattern instead. Brief descriptions or snippets of this type of pattern are known as patlets.

The work involved in comprehensively documenting a qualified pattern can be pretty daunting. Looking back at some of the earliest work in the field of design patterns, a pattern may be considered “good” if it does the following:

- Solves a particular problem
Patterns are not supposed to just capture principles or strategies. They need to capture solutions. This is one of the most essential ingredients of a good pattern.

- Does not have an obvious solution
We can find that problem-solving techniques often attempt to derive from well-known first principles. The best design patterns usually provide solutions to issues indirectly—this is considered a necessary approach for the most challenging problems related to design.

- Describes a proven concept
Design patterns require proof that they function as described, and without this proof, the design cannot be seriously considered. If a pattern is highly speculative in nature, only the brave will attempt to use it.

- Describes a relationship
In some cases, it may appear that a pattern describes a type of module. Despite what the implementation looks like, the official description of the pattern must describe much deeper system structures and mechanisms that explain its relationship to code.

We would be forgiven for thinking that a proto-pattern that fails to meet guidelines isn’t worth learning from; however, this is far from the truth. Many proto-patterns are actually quite good. I am not saying that all proto-patterns are worth looking at, but there are quite a few useful ones in the wild that could assist us with future projects. Use your best judgment with the above list in mind, and you’ll be fine in your selection process.

### Rule of Three
One of the additional requirements for a pattern to be valid is that it displays some recurring phenomenon. You can often qualify this in at least three key areas, referred to as the rule of three. To show recurrence using this rule, one must demonstrate the following:

- Fitness of purpose
How is the pattern considered successful?

- Usefulness
Why is the pattern considered successful?

- Applicability
Is the design worthy of being a pattern because it has broader applicability? If so, this needs to be explained. When reviewing or defining a pattern, it is vital to keep these areas in mind.

- Соответствие цели (Fitness of purpose)
Этот критерий задает вопрос: насколько этот паттерн является успешным для решения своей задачи?
Иными словами, нужно выяснить, действительно ли паттерн выполняет свою функцию в конкретной ситуации или контексте.

- Полезность (Usefulness)
Паттерн считается успешным, если он полезен. Этот критерий поднимает такие вопросы, как: «Почему этот паттерн считается эффективным?» и
«Какие выгоды он приносит в практическом использовании?». Полезность — это показатель его ценности.

- Применимость (Applicability)
Здесь речь идет о том, является ли данный паттерн универсальным и может ли он быть использован более широко, чем в одной конкретной ситуации.
Достойный паттерн должен быть применим не только в рамках одной проблемы, но и в других похожих или даже разных контекстах.
Это обоснование нужно четко объяснять, чтобы доказать его ценность.

#### Summary
This chapter has shown how every proposed proto-pattern may not always be accepted as a pattern. 
The next chapter shares the essential elements and best practices for structuring and documenting patterns so that the community can easily understand and consume them.
