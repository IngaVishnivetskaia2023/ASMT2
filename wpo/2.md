### LCP — Largest Contentful Paint
Determines how quickly the largest and the most important content on the site loads.

Reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport relative to when the page first started loading.

Sites should strive to have the Largest Contentful Paint of 2.5 seconds or less.

### INP — Interaction to Next Paint (Replaces FID — First Input Delay)
Determines how quickly a site responds to different interactions from the user (click, scroll, etc.).

INP measures the time from when a user interacts with the page (i.e. when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser is actually able to present the result of the interaction.

Sites should strive to have an INP of 200 milliseconds or less.

### CLS — Cumulative Layout Shift
Determines how much the layout is shifted and if it's stable or not.

A layout shift occurs any time a visible element changes its position from one rendered frame to the next. CLS is a measure of the largest burst of layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of a page.

Sites should strive to have a CLS score of 0.1 or less.
