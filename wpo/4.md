## Animations and performance

### Animations

#### JavaScript
- Use requestAnimationFrame() to control animations
- Use requestIdleCallback() to serve background work without impacting latency-critical events as animation and input response
#### CSS
- Animate only CSS properties that don't trigger layout:
1. transform: translate()
2. transform: rotate()
3. transform: scale()
4. opacity
5. For reasonable optimization use will-change
#### Web Animations API
It is one of the most performant ways to animate on the Web
