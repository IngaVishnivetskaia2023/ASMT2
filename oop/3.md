Most object-oriented languages support inheritance, which means a new class automatically inhabits the same properties and functionalities as its parent class. 
Inheritance allows you to organize classes into hierarchies, where a class might have one or more parent or child classes. 
If a class has a parent class, it means the class has inherited the properties of the parent. 
The child class can also modify or extend the behavior of its parent class. 
Inheritance allows you to reuse code without redefining the functions of a child class.

```
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.speed = 0;
    this.name = name;
  }
  run(speed) {
    this.speed = speed;
    alert(`${this.name} бежит со скоростью ${this.speed}.`);
  }
  stop() {
    this.speed = 0;
    alert(`${this.name} стоит неподвижно.`);
  }
}

let animal = new Animal("Мой питомец");

```
